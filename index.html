        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Exploring the Glucose Response of Diabetic Individual</h2>
        <p>Every meal triggers metabolic responses that affect glucose levels, with lasting health effects. Our project uses food logs and Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data to track glucose levels every five minutes, identifying patterns in response to different meals.</p>
        <p>We aim to uncover how the timing, type, and composition of meals affect glucose fluctuations and provide insights into managing blood sugar. By mapping glucose changes to mealsâ€”whether high in carbs, protein, or fatsâ€”we can visualize the impact of each on glucose stability.</p>
        <p>The graph below shows glucose fluctuations for several individuals across 1-2 weeks, with <strong>meal events</strong> marked on the timeline. Some meals cause sharp spikes, while others have more gradual or stable effects, highlighting the importance of meal timing and composition in managing glucose levels.</p>
        <h4>ðŸ”Ž Key Questions to Explore:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Which meals trigger glucose spikes or crashes?</li>
            <li>How long does it take for glucose levels to stabilize after eating?</li>
            <li>Are there patterns based on meal type or timing, such as breakfast versus dinner?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Explore the visualization below to see how meals impact blood sugar and gain insights for better glucose control.</p>
        <p> You can change datasets with the <strong>dropdown</strong> to explore differnt people's glucose as well as <strong>reset the zoom</strong> when needed. Also try <strong> hovering </strong> over meal events for some more insights!</p>

            From the radar chart, we gained insights into how the foods with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">highest Total Carbs</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sugar</span> impact <span style="font-weight: bold;">glucose spikes</span>. However, while the radar chart is great for comparing individual foods, it does not provide a broader perspective on how different food compositions contribute to overall glucose spike distributions.  
            <br><br>
            To bridge this gap, we introduced the <span style="font-weight: bold;">histogram</span>, which aggregates <span style="font-weight: bold;">maximum glucose change</span> across different nutrient combinations. This enables us to observe <span style="font-weight: bold;">general trends</span> and compare <span style="font-weight: bold;">multiple categories simultaneously</span>. Users can select specific levels of <strong>Total Carbs</strong>, <strong>Sugar</strong>, and <strong>Protein</strong> by clicking on the corresponding buttons to toggle between <strong>high</strong>, <strong>low</strong> and <strong>all</strong> values. To further enhance exploration, the <strong>Every Combination</strong> button animates the histogram, sequentially displaying all possible nutrient combinations. If needed, users can <strong>pause</strong> the animation at any time or <strong>reset</strong>the selection to return to the initial state. This interactive functionality provides a comprehensive view of glucose variability across different dietary compositions. <strong>Make sure to click "Every Combination" to populate the remaining visualizations! </strong></span>.

        <p>The Maximum Glucose Change Histogram categorizes meals based on their macronutrient compositionâ€”carbohydrates, sugar, fat, and proteinâ€”and visualizes the distribution of glucose spikes that follow within two hours of eating. Each bar in the histogram represents the frequency of meals that caused a certain level of glucose increase, allowing us to see how different types of meals impact blood sugar levels.</p>
        <p>To summarize this data, the Mean Glucose Spike Bar Chart condenses the histogramâ€™s information by displaying the average glucose response for each meal category. Instead of showing individual data points, the bar chart highlights the overall trend, making it easier to compare how different meal compositions affect blood sugar levels.</p>
        <p>The colors in the bar chart provide further insight:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong style="color: green;">Green</strong> represents meals that lead to low glucose spikes.</li>
            <li><strong style="color: blue;">Blue</strong> indicates moderate spikes.</li>
            <li><strong style="color: red;">Red</strong> highlights meals that cause high spikes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By deriving the bar chart from the histogram, we move from granular meal-level data to a broader summary, helping us quickly identify which meal types are better for glucose stability.</p>

    <section id="transition4" style="margin: 0 20px; text-align: left; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
        <p>After categorizing meals by their glucose impact, we now examine how blood sugar changes over time for each category. The <strong>Glucose Trends Over 2 Hours</strong> motion chart dynamically visualizes the average glucose response for low, medium, and high spike foods across a two-hour window post-meal.</p>
        <p>Each line in the chart represents one of the three previously declared categories. This visualization builds upon our previous insights. The Mean Glucose Spike Bar Chart summarized glucose responses by meal category, and now, the motion chart extends this understanding by mapping how glucose levels evolve over time for each category.</p>
        <p>By transitioning to this time-based view, we can observe how different meal compositions influence glucose stability beyond just the initial spike, offering a clearer picture of which foods promote sustained, healthy glucose levels.</p>

    <section id="conclusion" style="margin: 40px auto; max-width: 800px; text-align: left;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Final Takeaways</h2>
        <p>Through a series of visualizations, we've uncovered key insights into how different meal compositions affect glucose levels over time. From tracking individual glucose fluctuations to categorizing meals by their macronutrient profiles, our analysis reveals actionable strategies for maintaining stable blood sugar levels.</p>
    
        <h3>ðŸ”‘ Key Insights:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protein plays a crucial role:</strong> Meals with higher protein content are associated with more gradual glucose increases, potentially helping to mitigate sharp spikes.</li>
            <li><strong>Low-carb and low-sugar meals are consistently better:</strong> Foods lower in carbohydrates and sugar tend to promote more stable glucose levels, reducing the risk of large fluctuations.</li>
            <li><strong>Eating earlier in the day is beneficial:</strong> Glucose responses tend to be more stable when meals are consumed earlier rather than late at night, aligning with known circadian rhythm effects.</li>
            <li><strong>Carbohydrate-heavy meals lead to high spikes:</strong> Meals rich in refined carbs and sugars result in more dramatic blood sugar swings, emphasizing the importance of food choices for glucose management.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>ðŸŒŸ How Our Visualizations Explain This:</h3>
        <p>Our interactive visualizations take you through a step-by-step exploration of glucose responses:</p>
