        <h1>Food, Fitness, and Glucose: A Data-Driven Look at Metabolic Health</h1>
        <h2>BIG IDEAs Lab Glycemic Variability and Wearable Device Data</h2>
        <p>We aim to explore the relationship between dietary intake and glucose regulation using an interactive visualization. By analyzing participantsâ€™ food logsâ€”tracking what they eat, when they eat it, and the nutritional contentâ€”we will correlate these inputs with their continuous glucose readings recorded every five minutes by the Dexcom G6 sensor. Our approach will identify patterns in glucose response to different food types, meal timing, and macronutrient composition. Through dynamic charts and trend analyses, we will highlight individual variations in glucose metabolism and infer potential dietary impacts on prediabetes risk. This webpage will provide an intuitive way to examine how specific foods and meal timing influence glucose fluctuations.</p>

        <h3>How Do Your Meals Shape Your Blood Sugar Levels?</h3>
        <p>Every meal you eat sets off a cascade of metabolic responses, influencing your body's blood sugar levels in real time. But how exactly does your glucose fluctuate throughout the day, and what patterns emerge based on what and when you eat?</p>
        <p>Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data from the Dexcom G6 sensor, we can visualize these fluctuations over a full day, mapping each meal to its corresponding impact on blood sugar. By overlaying food intake onto a dynamic glucose trend line, we can see how different mealsâ€”whether rich in carbohydrates, proteins, or fatsâ€”affect glucose stability and overall metabolic health.</p>
        <p>In the interactive graph below, each <strong>meal event</strong> is marked along the timeline. Notice how some meals trigger sharp glucose spikes, while others result in steadier, more controlled changes. Click on a meal to explore its macronutrient composition and observe how the body responds in the minutes and hours that follow.</p>
        <h4>ðŸ”Ž What to Look For:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Do certain meals lead to rapid glucose spikes or crashes?</li>
            <li>How long does it take for glucose levels to return to baseline after eating?</li>
            <li>Are there patterns based on meal timing, such as breakfast vs. dinner?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Explore the visualization below to uncover the unique story behind each meal and its impact on blood sugar regulation.</p>
